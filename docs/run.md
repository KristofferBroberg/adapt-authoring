# Running the application
**Note**: you can find developer-specific instructions in `developer.md`.

To run the application, simply use the npm start script:
```
npm start
```

You can also set the NODE_ENV environment variable to specify which configuration file is loaded with the application. This value is `production` by default:
```
NODE_ENV=dev npm start
```
