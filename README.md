# Adapt Authoring Tool

This is a prototype for the restructure of the [Adapt authoring tool application](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues).

This repository marks the entry point, and only contains the code necessary to bootstrap the application. For the actual code, see the list of [`package.json` dependencies](https://github.com/taylortom/adapt-authoring/blob/master/package.json#L42-L47) (starting with the [adapt-authoring-core module](https://github.com/taylortom/adapt-authoring-core)).
